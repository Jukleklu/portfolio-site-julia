            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is Julia.
I am a UX/UI designer with a strong background in Fashion and Product Design.
I have always been interested in how to truely deliver what a customer wants and needs which led me to the field of User Experience and User Interface Design.

After studying at HfG Offenbach (Product Design / Pre-Diploma) and HGK Basel (Product & Fashion Design / BA), I was working as a fashion designer, developer and head of design in the fashion industry for several years. Fashion has a negative impact on society and on the environment - this eventually lead me to having a strong inner conflict. My personal standards regarding morality and ethical questions were in direct opposition to my job environment. Therefore, I was not able to enjoy what I used to love - designing a good product - without having to think about the toxic impact it may have. When I decided to leave the fashion industry for good, I did so to be able to re-balance this imbalance; I wanted to be able to taking on projects closer to my heart and my ethical standards. As I have always been interested in how to truely deliver what a customer wants, I decided to shift back into a more product focussed and user-centred environment, combining my ongoing love for technology and good design.

For me, UX and UI design have the potential to be the design discipline closest to people’s hearts, minds and needs, and that is what I love about it and why I believe it has a huge impact on people’s lifes which will only continue to grow.

My main goal is to create inclusive, innovative, modern and progressive  products which are able to provide meaningful and valuable experiences.

Focussing on creating user-centric and innovative solutions to make a positive impact on people’s lives is what drives me. After acquiring a broad visual & design  foundation at uni, I was able to apply those skills working in fashion and product design in national and international design contexts.
